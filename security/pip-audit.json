This instructs caches not to cache the response, as it may contain information specific to a logged in user. This is handled in most cases, but some forms of access such as the Python `in` operator were overlooked.  The severity depends on the application's use of the session, and the cache's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.  1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not ignore responses with cookies. 2. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached. 3. The application accesses the session in a way that does not access the values, only the keys, and does not mutate the session."}]}, {"name": "flask-sqlalchemy", "version": "3.1.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "flask-login", "version": "0.6.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "cryptography", "version": "46.0.3", "vulns": [{"id": "CVE-2026-26007", "fix_versions": ["46.0.5"], "aliases": ["GHSA-r6ph-v2qm-q3c2"], "description": "## Vulnerability Summary  The `public_key_from_numbers` (or `EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.public_key()`), `EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.public_key()`, `load_der_public_key()` and `load_pem_public_key()` functions do not verify that the point belongs to the expected prime-order subgroup of the curve.  This missing validation allows an attacker to provide a public key point `P` from a small-order subgroup.  This can lead to security issues in various situations, such as the most commonly used signature verification (ECDSA) and shared key negotiation (ECDH). When the victim computes the shared secret as `S = [victim_private_key]P` via ECDH,  this leaks information about `victim_private_key mod (small_subgroup_order)`. For curves with cofactor > 1, this reveals the least significant bits of the private key.  When these weak public keys are used in ECDSA , it's easy to forge signatures on the small subgroup.  Only SECT curves are impacted by this.  ## Credit  This vulnerability was discovered by: - XlabAI Team of Tencent Xuanwu Lab - Atuin Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine"}]}, {"name": "asn1crypto", "version": "1.5.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "werkzeug", "version": "3.1.5", "vulns": [{"id": "CVE-2026-27199", "fix_versions": ["3.1.6"], "aliases": ["GHSA-29vq-49wr-vm6x"], "description": "Werkzeug's `safe_join` function allows Windows device names as filenames if when preceded by other path segments.
